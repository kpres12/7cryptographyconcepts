## Cryptography Concepts Implementation

This repository contains implementations of several cryptography concepts, as demonstrated in the Fireship video, ["7 Cryptography Concepts EVERY Developer Should Know"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuyzuNBFWxQ).

## Getting Started

Each concept is demonstrated in a separate file, with comments explaining the key points and how they relate to the broader cryptography principles.

## Acknowledgements
